# Tunes and More
## Project Overview
Tunes and More is a music player app designed as a tool for the development of Spotify extensions. Because Spotify has rate limits, it isn't always ideal to use the Spotify API for testing and development. Tunes and More is a custom music app that simulates key functionality of Spotify to allow for more rapid testing and development of Spotify extensions without hitting any rate limits.

One extension that Tunes and More will be used to develop is SoundShift. The core functionality of SoundShift is to implement a listening policy to ensure that the same song isn't heard too frequently. On major music platforms, the user can select an option to find similar music, such as creating a radio station. If the user keeps searching for similar music, especially from within a search for similar music, the same songs often end up playing over and over. SoundShift is intended to prevent this by notifying the user, so that they can search for new music.
